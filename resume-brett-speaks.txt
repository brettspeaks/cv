ABOUT

Brett is a full-stack software engineer with 13+ years experience. He enjoys 
tinkering with the latest technologies, the challenge of solving very hard 
problems in creative ways, and delivering quality code in dynamic, fast paced 
environments. In his last job, there were several major company projects that 
were about to be cancelled, and he dove in and re-wrote software that processes 
over $60M per month in collections inventory. For the last 5 years, he has 
actively worked with dynamic languages such as Python, Perl, Bash, and JavaScript. 
The previous 7+ years, he worked mostly with strongly typed languages such as 
Java, C#, and C++.
